### If you wish to contribute, please follow these guidelines:

#### Author Comment:
The **Author Comment** is a comment at the beginning of every editable file in this Repository. It signifies the original author of the file and the date of the file's creation, along with the name of the last person to update the file, and the date of the last update. The format is as follows (shown in the **CSS** styling):

```css
/*
        Author: (Author's Name)
        Created: (Date of Creation)

        Updated By: (Name of Last Person to Update the File)
        Updated: (Date of Last Update)
*/
```

This must be updated regularly, as it helps maintain the files in an easy and orderly manner.

#### SCSS:
The styling for this website was written in, and is being maintained in, **SCSS**. I would require any stylesheets created or edited to be done using the **SCSS** syntax and file extension, to be compiled into **CSS** before _commiting_ and _pushing_.

### Other than that, welcome to the Repository, and have fun!
